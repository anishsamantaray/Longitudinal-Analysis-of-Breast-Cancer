# Breast Cancer Prognosis Analysis 

  Breast Cancer is of the <strong> most common cancer </strong> not only affecting women but also men. Diagnosis becomes very critical in such a situation  ,
  but after diagnosis and curing also doesnâ€™t lead a normal life , biopsies become a common part of their journey which is very painful. 
  <strong>In such a situation we have proposed to do Longitudinal analysis of Breast cancer patients . It can be done using Machine Learning and Deep Learning analysis 
  and exploratory data analysis using PowerBI </strong>.

## Requirements

1. Python 3.10
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pycharm IDE/ any other code editor or IDE
4. PowerBI for PowerBI Report
  
## Libraries Required

```bash
pip install numpy as np
pip install Flask
pip install pickle5
pip install lightgbm
```

Won a Bronze medal for contributing the kernal in Kaggle

## Approach

1. Reading the Data.
2. Data Pre-Processing --- Clearing null values, Removing columns which have correlation >0.8 with other column, Log Transforming Skewed Columns, Checking if data is balanced.
3. Applied ML models and check perfomance metrics.
4. Since data is unbalanced add class_wight=balanced Hyperparameter,Check performance metrics.
5. Applied PCA and Checked Performance Metrics.
6. Export the preprocessed dataset for PowerBI operations.
7. Export Best model i.e. LightGBM as Pickle File.
8. Created a Web app using Flask and import pickle file and design it.
9. Deploy using a Cloud Service.

## Performance Metrics

The Highest accuracy is recievced by LightGBM which IS 87.8%, after PCA logistic Regression gives the highest around 84% and with balnced weight class Random Forest gives highest with 87.8%.
The complete Results is to be viewed in Result excel sheet.
